# lc - line counter
This is a lines (of code) counter, that i threw together in like half an hour, because other ones (e.g. cloc or tokei) don't allow you to filter for custom file extensions and only scan known languages. But i need one that can count any file extension.
## building
#### windows:
```
make build
```
(with pyinstaller)
#### linux:
too lazy, sorry (╥‸╥)
